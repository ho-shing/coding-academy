Welcome to the this coding tutorials. Our goal is to provide resources (including content and community) to help you to learn to code.

# Motivation

We believe that anyone should and can learn to code, and coding is beneficial.

Coding can

* train your logical thinking skill
* solve real problems

Although coding skills are useful, we found that learners are not motivated due to the following:

* Do not have a clear motivation or objective
* Do not have peers to motivate each other
* Do not have proper guidance by mentors

What we want to do is to provide an entry point for accessing the learning content and community.

We are different because

* We provide a learning path for learners, i.e. we'll tell you if you want to build certain things, you have to learn this, this and this.
* We are project-based instead of course-based. We provide sample projects so that learners can build it themselves and learn the required skills to build such projects.
* We have a community (including peers and mentors) so that you can ask questions along the way.
* Mentors will guide you through your personalized project.
